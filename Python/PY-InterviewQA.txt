1.	What is init keyword ?

	The __init__ method is known as a constructor in object-oriented programming (OOP) terminology.
It is used to initialize an object’s state when it is created.
Automatically called when a new instance of a class is instantiated.
Purpose:
Assign values to object properties.
Perform any initialization operations.

Example:

class BookShop:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title

    def book(self):
        print('The title of the book is', self.title)

b = BookShop('Sandman')
b.book()  # Output: The title of the book is Sandman


2.	What is self keyword ?

	
	In Python, self refers to the instance of a class that is currently being used.
It is used within instance methods to access and modify the object’s attributes.
When you call a method on an object, the object itself is automatically passed as the first argument (using self).

Example:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}")

p = Person("Alice")
p.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice
